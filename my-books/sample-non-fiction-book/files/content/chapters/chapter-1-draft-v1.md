# Chapter 1 — Sketching the Idea in 20 Minutes

<!-- METADATA
version: 1
status: draft
words: 260
created: demo-run
modified: demo-run
-->

> **Purpose:** Show how the pipeline moves from a filled-out PROJECT.md to a usable first-draft page in under half an hour.

1. **Frame the problem.** Define the reader's pain point in two sentences and link it to the book's promise.
2. **Pick a single case study.** Use a real or hypothetical team sprint and include one metric (cycle time, defects, or throughput).
3. **Note the constraint.** Mention what you are deliberately *not* covering in this short pass.
4. **Call the next step.** Suggest what Researcher should validate before editing (e.g., citation or benchmark).

This stub is intentionally short so a screen recording shows the transition from outline → draft without long waits. Replace the numbered bullets with prose once Researcher signs off.
