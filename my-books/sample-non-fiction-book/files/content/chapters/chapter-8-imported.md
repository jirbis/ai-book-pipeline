## Promise
Handle ETH with its own catalysts and rhythm instead of mirroring BTC tactics.

## Outline
- Drivers: L2 growth, fees/burn, dev milestones
- Behavioral differences vs. BTC in bull/bear/regime shifts
- Sizing ETH relative to BTC and L2 exposure
- Exit/hedge signals: gas spikes, funding flips, narrative rotations
- Example trade that respected ETH-specific signals

## Research & Evidence To Collect
- [ ] ETH gas/fee data sources; L2 activity metrics
- [ ] Historical ETH/BTC performance across regimes
