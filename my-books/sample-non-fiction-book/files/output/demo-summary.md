# Demo Summary for sample-non-fiction-book

This project now contains stub outputs for the first two phases so you can record a walkthrough quickly.

## Files created
- files/handoff/demo-phase-log.md — quick narrative of Phase 1 → Phase 2
- files/content/chapters/chapter-0-outline.md — outline-sized kick-off
- files/content/chapters/chapter-1-draft-v1.md — short draft ready for screenshots
- files/research/chapter-1-research.md — supporting notes for the first chapter

## Suggested next steps
- Open config/PROJECT.md to personalize the title and scope.
- Run a screen recording while opening the outline and draft to show the transition.
- Hand off to EDITOR or CRITIC by dropping a comment in files/handoff/.
