# Chapter 0 — Demo Outline (Fiction)

## Goal
Set the tone and scope for a 2–3 chapter book sprint.

## Beats
1. Hook the reader with a promise of value.
2. Introduce the main tension or thesis.
3. Preview how the next chapter delivers on the promise.

## Notes
- Keep it under 250 words so the draft renders quickly during demos.
- Emphasize the "Phase 1 → Phase 2" handoff so screenshots show progress.
