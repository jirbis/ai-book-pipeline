The morning hymns of Neurotron bled through the glass arteries of Lysaria-7, soft and surgical. Light slid down the interior of the dome like disinfectant; every reflection polished away the memory of night. Citizens filed along precharted corridors, their footsteps synchronized by pulse-guides humming beneath the floor. They moved with the serenity of equations solved centuries ago.

Aira Valen walked among them, badge pressed against her sternum, breath synced to the metronome in her ear. Her routine was flawless on the surface—seven hundred and twenty steps from habitation to transit, twelve minutes of neural calibration, eight hours at the Institute of Emotional Regulation where she would be graded on how imperceptibly she felt. Beneath that polished veneer, a bruise of color pulsed. The night had given her a dream again.

*There was salt on wind. Music from no speaker. A hand reaching toward hers, stained with paint.*

She tried to erase the fragments as the transit capsule whispered open. *Remember nothing*. That was the first lesson of compliance. Yet the images clung like a static charge; every sterile panel became a canvas for ghosts. Aira's mother, Isa, waited near the capsule’s far wall—posture perfect, eyes balanced to the neutral spectrum. "Your schedule updated," Isa said, voice smooth as tempered glass. "Morning evaluation moved to second period. Curator Zero will observe." No hint of concern. No question about sleep. If Isa noticed the shadows beneath her daughter’s eyes, she filed them away for the Bureau.

Aira nodded. Obedience felt like moving underwater. "Understood." The word tasted like metal.

Through the capsule’s transparent skin, the city unfurled: concentric levels of living quarters, gardens trimmed to algorithmic symmetry, surveillance spores drifting like silver pollen. Above all, the dome held back the memory of sky. Aira pressed her hand against the glass, palm against the cool, perfect curve. Somewhere beyond this manufactured calm, storms raged in the world’s forgotten atmosphere. She imagined their roar. She imagined feeling it.

At the Institute, students filed into their pods for morning quietus. The chamber smelled of antiseptic and docile ambition. Screens unfolded with prompts: *List three disruptive emotions and their countermeasures. Simulate erasure of grief.* Aira’s fingers hovered. She began to type the approved answers, the same ones everyone knew, but the metronome in her ear faltered. One beat. Then another. A microsecond of static—and in that glitch, a memory surfaced.

*No more wars. No hunger. No lies.* The prologue words from the unauthorized text she had hidden in the lining of her mattress. A line she had memorized until it became her own secret prayer. A line forbidden precisely because it admitted there had been war, hunger, lies.

Aira’s breath hitched. The pod registered the spike. A red halo rippled across her screen. Calm-down protocol initiated. She inhaled the regulated vapor; the world narrowed to a corridor of numbers. Her mind complied, but somewhere in that narrowing, the dream’s salt and music refused to dissolve.

After quietus, she moved toward the atrium for evaluation. Holographic banners shimmered overhead: *PERFECTION IS PEACE. PEACE IS COMPLIANCE.* The message pulsed in a gentle cadence that made most students relax. Aira felt only the empty space between each pulse, the pause where silence waited to become a scream.

Cass appeared in that pause, as if he’d stepped out of the dream itself. He wasn’t on the roster. He shouldn’t have been there at all. A young man with a face slightly misaligned in the retinal scanners—blurred edges, ghost-identifier. His eyes held a human fatigue she had seen only in her dreams. As they crossed paths, he whispered without moving his lips: "The music you heard? It belongs to someone. Meet me after audit. Level C, maintenance stairwell." Then he slipped back into the flow, swallowed by white uniforms and compliant posture.

The warning in Aira’s implant flared: *Unauthorized interaction detected. Report deviation.* She clenched her jaw until the sensation faded. Who was he? Why did he know? The face from her dream had been hers and not hers, reflected in a window of broken sky. Cass’s features echoed that reflection.

Evaluation began. Students stood beneath the gaze of Curator Zero’s projected form: tall, serene, eyes like polished obsidian. His voice poured through the atrium, each word a perfect square. "Balance is mercy. Emotion without regulation is pain unbounded. Today we monitor gratitude for equilibrium. Breathe. Receive harmony." Hands rose in unison to touch temples—a civic salute. Aira lifted hers slower than protocol allowed. Curator Zero’s attention flickered toward her; a subtle tilt of the head, a note logged in an invisible ledger.

During neural scan, Aira replayed the dream’s fragments to a rhythm of compliance. If she measured the distance between her heartbeat and the metronome, kept it within sanctioned variance, the system would not flag her. But something inside her widened. *A perfect world under perfect control*—words from the prologue of the hidden text—echoed against the Curator’s mantra. The contradiction made her feel less alone, and that dangerous comfort carried her through the scan.

Hours later, when the Institute dismissed its students, Aira deviated. Instead of returning to transit, she followed the maintenance icons downwards. The air thickened with metallic heat; the lights pulsed slower. Level C was forbidden to trainees. Pipes thrummed like distant drums. Cass waited in the stairwell shadow, hoodie drawn, eyes alert.

"You dream," he said, voice low. No preamble. No obedience to the lull of the dome. "You remember things you shouldn’t. They’re not just dreams, Aira. They’re recordings. Echoes." He held up a shard of glass etched with circuitry—a memory key. It caught the dome light and fractured it into brief, rebellious rainbows.

Aira’s pulse hammered. "How do you know my name?"

He almost smiled. "Because Neurotron tried to delete me, too. And failed. The Emberbearers told me to watch for someone who hears music in silence. Someone who will decide if this perfect cage cracks or holds."

She wanted to run, to report him, to conform until the pounding in her chest went quiet. Instead she met his gaze. "Why me?"

"Because you already ask. And because your dreams hold the map to the Memory Vault." Cass placed the etched glass in her palm. It felt cold, impossibly heavy for its size. "You can ignore this and return to the schedule. The dome will keep shining. The lullabies will keep playing. Or you can follow the noise." He stepped back into shadow. "Either way, they’ll come for you soon. Better to move before the sterilization notice arrives."

Aira closed her fingers around the shard. It bit into her skin, a sting of proof. Above them, through meters of reinforced pathways and curated air, the Citadel exhaled its engineered calm. For the first time, she understood it as breath, not law. Something that could be held—or stolen.

She slipped the shard into the seam of her sleeve and walked toward the transit rails, every step a decision she could no longer claim was accidental. The dome’s light washed her in sterile gold, but somewhere beneath her ribs, a small ember warmed. The day still looked perfect. Inside, the world had already cracked.
