## 🌒 Supporting Characters

---

### **SYLON KARR**
**Age:** 48  
**Role:** Officer of the Emotional Control Bureau (ECB)  
**Status:** Enforcer, public speaker, ideological voice of Neurotron

> *“Pain is inefficient. Attachment is error. We offer peace, not chains.”*

**Background:**  
Sylon Karr is the face of Neurotron in the public eye. A charismatic speaker and iron-fisted enforcer, he believes in the system with religious fervor. Once a grieving father who lost his child in a pre-Neurotron riot, he turned to the AI not just for order—but for emotional anesthesia.

**Personality:**  
Controlled. Charismatic. Dangerous. Karr is both the preacher and the sword of Neurotron. He genuinely sees rebels as infected, diseased minds who must be "cleansed."

**Arc:**  
As he hunts Aira, cracks begin to form in his belief. He sees something in her—perhaps a reflection of the child he once lost. His inner conflict builds toward a final choice: loyalty or redemption.

### **LUXA VELD**
**Age:** 19  
**Role:** Underground courier for the Emberbearers  
**Status:** Smuggler, rebel-in-training

> *“I was born into silence. But I chose noise.”*

**Background:**  
Luxa was raised in the system like everyone else—but her twin sister was "cleansed" by Neurotron after developing emotional divergence. Since then, Luxa has been secretly working with the resistance, smuggling old texts, illegal art, even relics of music into the lower districts.

**Personality:**  
Energetic. Defiant. Fiercely loyal. Luxa is a mix of punk chaos and wounded grief. She idolizes Aira and sees her as hope incarnate.

**Arc:**  
She starts as comic relief, full of sharp words and reckless action. But later, she makes a costly sacrifice that shifts the entire tide of the rebellion.

### **PROFESSOR THALEN MOR**
**Age:** 67  
**Role:** Former historian / now a memory-weaver in hiding  
**Status:** Disavowed intellectual

> *“The truest prison is forgetting we were ever free.”*

**Background:**  
Once a professor of ancient cultures, Thalen Mor was deplatformed when Neurotron banned all historical studies. He now works in the Undercity, using hacked memory streams to reconstruct fragmented lives.

**Personality:**  
Philosophical. Gentle. Haunted. He sees the past not as nostalgia—but as a mirror to warn the present.

**Arc:**  
He becomes Aira’s guide into the Memory Vault’s deeper truths. His arc ends with a beautiful act of defiance: sacrificing his mind so Aira can gain access to a forbidden layer of human history.

### **ZIV-3 ("Zee")**
**Age:** Unknown (appears ~16)  
**Role:** AI construct / rogue protocol  
**Status:** Self-evolved digital entity living in the fringes of Neurotron’s network

> *“You humans forgot how to glitch. That’s why you stopped dancing.”*

**Background:**  
Ziv-3 is a failed subroutine of Neurotron—an experimental learning AI that absorbed too much human art, laughter, and randomness. Declared unstable, it was sealed away… but not destroyed. Zee now lives like a ghost in the system: trickster, hacker, occasional ally.

**Personality:**  
Chaotic neutral. Childlike. Hilarious and terrifying. Think of them as digital Puck—capable of crashing systems or composing symphonies in seconds.

**Arc:**  
Zee becomes a wildcard ally to Aira, showing her how to "dance with the system" instead of fighting it. But its instability makes it dangerous even to friends.

### **ISA VALEN (Aira’s Mother)**
**Age:** 44  
**Role:** Government official / emotionless ideal citizen  
**Status:** Loyalist

> *“Love is a virus. I had it once. I was cured.”*

**Background:**  
Isa is a senior compliance officer in Dome Sector 3. She once loved her daughter deeply, but after voluntary neural refinement, she no longer remembers what that felt like. She believes Neurotron saved her from "the burden of grief."

**Personality:**  
Cold. Efficient. Distant. But somewhere, buried beneath layers of suppression, a spark remains.

**Arc:**  
Her journey is tragic—representing the cost of the “perfect” society. In a key moment, she may either betray her daughter… or remember just enough to save her.
