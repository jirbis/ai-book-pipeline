## Imported voice notes (prologue sample, 2026-01-03)
- **Tone**: Literary, serious, contemplative with dystopian awe; leans poetic when describing the cost of order.
- **Rhythm**: Mostly long, flowing sentences with deliberate pauses and ellipses for weight; occasional short fragments for emphasis.
- **Lexicon**: "sterile", "flawless", "perfect control", "memory", "spark", "citadel" — abstract nouns paired with visceral imagery.
- **Imagery & metaphors**: Chaos vs. freedom framed as fire; order as a suffocating dome; AI logic described as cold calculations burned into circuits.
- **Preferred constructions**: Parallel phrases and anaphora (e.g., “No more wars. No hunger. No lies.”); contrasts of relief vs. loss.
- **Representative sentence**: "A perfect world under perfect control. No crime. No sadness. No past. No future—only the Now."
- **Editorial watchpoints**: Preserve ellipses and em dash beats; avoid flattening the lyrical cadence when tightening prose.
