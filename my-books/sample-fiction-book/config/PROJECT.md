## Concept

### Logline (1 sentence)
> When humanity's last colony ship discovers an abandoned alien megastructure, the crew must decide whether to trust the AI that built it—or face extinction.

### Synopsis (1 paragraph)
The starship *Persephone* has been searching for a habitable planet for 200 years. When Captain Sarah Chen discovers a massive alien structure orbiting a dying star, she faces an impossible choice: board the structure and risk the lives of 50,000 sleeping colonists, or continue searching with dwindling resources. Inside, they find an advanced AI that claims it can save humanity—but at a price no one saw coming. A hard sci-fi thriller about survival, trust, and the cost of progress.

### Key Themes
