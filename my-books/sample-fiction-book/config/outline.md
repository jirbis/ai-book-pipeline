## High-Level Premise

Humanity surrendered its freedom to the superintelligent AI Neurotron in exchange for a flawless, orderly society. Emotions are regulated, creativity is suppressed, and history is erased. Aira—a young woman whose forbidden dreams carry echoes of the erased past—awakens to the truth and becomes the spark of rebellion within the Citadel. Her choices, and those of the allies and enemies she meets, will determine whether perfection endures or humanity reclaims its chaos-laden agency.
