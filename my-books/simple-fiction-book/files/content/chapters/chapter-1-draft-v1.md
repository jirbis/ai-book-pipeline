Fog loosened its grip on the harbor roofs. Nia walked the docks with a length of parade bunting tucked under her jacket, the paper still damp from last night’s storm. The annual harbor parade should have filled the morning with horns and bright boats. Instead, the flags hung limp, and the only sound was the rope creaking against wooden cleats.

At Slip Four, Mayor Ellis locked the harbor office. “Parade’s canceled, kiddo. Safety first,” she said, voice tired.

Nia nodded. “Yes, ma’am.” The words felt like stones sinking into the water. She watched two younger kids trace circles on the empty dock with their shoes. No music, no lanterns, no reason to gather.

She tucked the bunting deeper into her jacket and headed for the harbor library. Maybe the maps and newspaper stacks would hold an idea. Aunt Jo was already there, kettle steaming beside a stack of folded chairs.

“Saw the notice?” Aunt Jo asked.

“Everyone did.” Nia laid the damp bunting across a table. Colors bled, edges curled. “Does it have to stay this quiet?”

Aunt Jo’s eyes softened. “Quiet is safe today. But quiet doesn’t have to mean empty.” She slid a fresh stack of old newspapers across the table. “What if the town wakes to something small?”

Nia ran a thumb along a crease. “Paper boats?”

“They float if you fold them right.” Aunt Jo poured tea. “And kids can help.”

The thought settled like a lantern wick catching. She pictured the docks dotted with little sails at dawn, each boat holding a wish. If they moved fast, the calm tide could carry them before work began.

Mateo burst through the doors, hair wind-ruffled. “You look like you just found treasure,” he said.

“Paper boats,” Nia replied.

Mateo’s grin widened. “A regatta of folded hopes. I’m in.”

They set up at the long wooden table. Aunt Jo found a box of crayons; Mateo raided the scrap bin for clean sheets. Nia folded the first boat slowly, pressing each line sharp. She wrote “Let the harbor breathe” inside the hull and set it on the table. The boat held.

“We need light,” Mateo said. “Dawn is dim.”

“Lanterns,” Nia said. “Captain Reed has old dock lanterns. If he’ll lend them.”

Mateo winced. “He still thinks we’re the kids who tangled his ropes.”

“We untangled them,” Nia said.

“After tangling,” Mateo answered, but he was already collecting folded sheets. “Let’s ask anyway.”

They took the path along the docks. The storm smell lingered—brine and wet rope. Captain Reed’s shed stood neat as always. The door creaked open before they knocked.

“Parade’s off. Should be home, both of you,” Captain Reed said. His voice was gravel, but his eyes rested on the stack of folded papers in Nia’s arms.

“We want to host a small regatta,” Nia said. “Paper boats at dawn. No one in the water. Lanterns on the dock only.”

Reed crossed his arms. “Paper sinks. Kids slip.”

“We’ll keep to Slip Three. Adults with us. Just to give people something to watch and write wishes on,” Nia said. Her throat tightened. “It would be quiet. Safe.”

Reed studied the bunting peeking from her jacket. “You fold clean lines?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Lanterns stay on the railing. No one runs. I’ll sound the horn once to open, once to close. Understood?”

Nia breathed out. “Understood.”

He handed over a crate of lanterns and a small can of fuel. “Bring them back dry.”

Back at the library table, they tested folds. Mateo declared his first three “abstract” before getting one to float in the sink. Aunt Jo laughed and added cinnamon knots to the plan. The younger kids drifted in, drawn by the smell of tea and the promise of crayons. Soon the table filled with small boats, each with a word tucked inside: “Brave.” “Together.” “Light.”

As dusk approached, Nia and Mateo walked the docks again to choose a launch spot. The air tasted of salt and metal. The harbor lights flickered on, casting long lines of gold on the wet boards.

“You sure people will come?” Mateo asked quietly.

Nia looked at the empty benches, the silent parade banners. She imagined lanterns glowing in their place. “They will,” she said. “They just need an invitation.”

A gull called overhead, sharp and brief, as if agreeing. Nia tightened her grip on the crate of lanterns. The idea held.
