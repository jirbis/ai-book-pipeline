Night settled in layers: first the streetlamps, then the lanterns Captain Reed loaned them, finally the glow from the harbor library windows. Nia, Mateo, and Aunt Jo turned the long table into a folding line. Sheets of newspaper stacked at one end, finished boats at the other, each tagged with a small strip of masking tape to keep the bows crisp.

“We need a sign,” Mateo said. “Otherwise it’s just us and our best origami career.”

Nia wrote in thick marker on cardboard: **DAWN REGATTA — WISHES WELCOME — SAFE LAUNCH**. She taped the bunting along the bottom edge. The colors were faded, but they still lifted the room.

The first visitor was Mr. Han from the bait shop. “Saw the lights,” he said. “Parade’s gone. What’s this?”

“A small replacement,” Aunt Jo answered. “Paper boats with wishes inside. Dawn tide.”

Mr. Han ran a finger along the cardboard sign. “No loud horns?”

“Just Captain Reed’s,” Mateo said. “Two toots. Polite ones.”

Mr. Han smiled and sat down to fold. His hands moved like he was wrapping minnows; precise, gentle. He wrote **steady work** on his slip before tucking it into the hull.

Word spread faster than Nia expected. Harbor kids arrived with their parents. The twins from the bakery came with parchment that smelled faintly of butter. Mayor Ellis peeked in, eyebrows raised.

“We have adults on the dock, lanterns on railings, and only Slip Three,” Nia recited before the mayor could ask.

Ellis glanced at Captain Reed’s crate of lanterns, at Aunt Jo’s careful list of volunteers, and relaxed. “All right. Keep the walkway clear. I’ll stop by at sunrise.”

With each visitor, the stack of boats grew. Some were lopsided, some perfectly crisp. Mateo lined them up like a tiny fleet. Aunt Jo brewed more tea and passed out a few flashlights for kids to check their folds. Laughter rose in soft waves; nothing loud enough to wake the neighborhood, just enough to warm the room.

“What about rain?” Mateo asked as he tied the last piece of bunting to the library’s doorframe.

Nia checked the weather app and the sky beyond the window. “Clear until mid-morning. The tide turns at seven. We have a window.”

They carried finished boats to Captain Reed’s shed to dry near the lanterns. Reed inspected a sample and nodded once. “Lines are true. Keep them off the ground,” he said. He gave them a small air horn. “If a kid gets near the edge, one short blast.”

Mateo practiced. The horn squeaked, more startled duck than alarm. They laughed.

Near midnight, the flow slowed. Aunt Jo dimmed the library lights. “Go home and sleep. Dawn will come fast,” she said.

Nia and Mateo stacked the last dozen boats in a shallow crate lined with dry cloth. Outside, the harbor was a black mirror. Streetlamps drew gold ladders across the water. The silence felt less empty now—more like waiting.

“What if only the five of us show up?” Mateo asked as they walked.

“Then five of us launch wishes,” Nia said. She meant it, but she pictured the benches empty again and felt her stomach pinch.

She paused at the parade banner still pinned to the market rail. It fluttered weakly in the breeze. She smoothed it flat and retied one corner. “We should leave a note,” she said.

Mateo pulled a pen from behind his ear. Together they wrote: **REGATTA AT DAWN — BRING A WISH**. They pinned it where the parade schedule had hung.

At home, Nia laid out her clothes, tucked a pencil behind her ear, and set three extra sheets of paper on her desk. The harbor outside her window was a shadow; the gulls were asleep. She whispered to the dark, “Let the harbor breathe.”

Sleep came in brief, salty dreams—boats that glowed, hands reaching, the tide lifting everything that was heavy. She woke before her alarm, heart steady. The window showed a faint blue edge over the water. Dawn was coming, and with it, the chance to see if the town would answer.
