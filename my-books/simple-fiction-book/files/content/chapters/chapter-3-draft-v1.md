The sky was only just thinking of morning when Nia reached Slip Three. She breathed in brine and damp wood. The harbor lamps threw soft pools of light along the railing where lanterns waited. Mateo jogged up beside her, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

“Anyone here?” he whispered.

Captain Reed stepped from the shadows, hat pulled low. “Been here an hour. Calm water. You’re clear.”

Nia set the crate of boats on a bench. The paper hulls looked small against the dark water, but their folds held firm. Aunt Jo arrived with a thermos of hot tea and a stack of blank slips. “For late wishes,” she said.

The first visitors were the bakery twins, yawning and wrapped in scarves. They placed their parchment boats on the table. One read **mom’s hands healed**; the other, **sunny weekends**. More neighbors followed, quiet footfalls on the dock. Mr. Han carried a tray of bait-shop coffee. Mayor Ellis appeared with a flashlight and a nod. The dock filled slowly, as if the town was relearning how to stand together.

Nia explained the plan in a low voice. “We’ll light lanterns along the rail. Boats go one by one, gentle push, no tossing. Listen for Captain Reed: first horn to start, second to finish.”

Captain Reed lit the first lantern. Warm light brushed across the water. He lifted the harbor horn, hesitated for a breath, then gave a short, steady blast. The sound carried across the cove like a promise.

Nia crouched at the edge, heart beating with the lantern flame. She chose a boat with **quiet bravery** written inside and set it on the surface. The paper bobbed, caught a small current, and glided forward. Mateo lowered one next—**cinnamon knots always**—and grinned.

One by one, boats slipped into the tide. Parents guided small hands. Teens laughed softly as they tried to outfold each other. Aunt Jo wrote **stories shared** on a slip and tucked it into a blue boat. Mr. Han whispered something Nia couldn’t hear and gave his boat the gentlest push.

Lantern light turned the water into a field of slow-moving stars. The harbor, once empty, now murmured with the sound of soft conversation, the crackle of lantern wicks, the occasional splash of a boat adjusting course. A seal head surfaced near the far slip, curious, then disappeared with barely a ripple.

Midway through, a breeze picked up. A few boats drifted toward a piling. Nia reached with the long-handled net Captain Reed had set aside. “No hands in,” he reminded, but his voice was kinder than his words. Nia guided the drifting boats back to open water. The dock released a breath she hadn’t realized it was holding.

Mateo leaned on the rail. “Look. They’re all moving together now.”

Nia followed the slow procession. Wishes trailed like quiet constellations. She spotted **steady work**, **brighter springs**, **new music nights**, **safe harbor**. Each slip of paper rode the tide like a small lantern of its own.

As the eastern clouds turned from blue to pink, Captain Reed lifted the horn again. He waited until the last child stepped back from the edge. The second blast was softer, a low note that settled over the water.

People didn’t leave right away. They watched their boats drift past the breakwater. Someone hummed a tune from last year’s parade. Aunt Jo poured tea until the thermos emptied. Mayor Ellis wiped her eyes discreetly with her sleeve.

“You did this,” Mateo said quietly to Nia.

“We did,” she corrected, though the warmth in her chest said both could be true.

When the sun finally cleared the horizon, the boats were small points toward the open water. The tide would carry them out, then back in as pulped paper, but for now they looked like a stitched line between town and sea.

Captain Reed cleared his throat. “Parade’s not the only way to gather,” he said. “You kids reminded us.”

Nia smiled. “Maybe next year we do both.”

“Maybe we do,” Reed agreed. He lifted his lantern, and the rest of the dock answered by lifting theirs. For a breath, the harbor looked like it was singing. Quiet, but singing.

They packed up slowly. Mateo counted the empty crates; Aunt Jo collected stray slips. Nia folded the cardboard sign and tucked it under her arm. The bunting from the parade hung nearby, its colors still faded but now less sad. She retied a corner, this time firmly.

Walking home, Nia heard footsteps fall into rhythm with hers—neighbors heading to work, kids whispering about whose boat went farthest. The harbor was awake again. Not because of music or banners, but because a handful of paper boats had carried the town’s words out with the tide and brought back the sound of shared breath.
