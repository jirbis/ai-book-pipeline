## Intentional Deviations from Norms

**Allowed Deviations**:
1. **Fragment endings**: Used to land emotion softly. Preserve.  
   - Example: "The harbor listened. So did she."

   - Example: "Paper, lanterns, breath, tide."

**Neologisms and Author's Words**:
- None yet; keep any future coined harbor phrases intact if they fit tone.

## Taboos (what author avoids)

**Don't Use**:
- Harsh conflict verbs like "attack," "slam."
- Heavy sarcasm or eye-rolling tone.
- Complex nautical jargon that breaks readability.

**Unacceptable Devices**:
- Grim descriptions of injury or disaster — story stays gentle.
- Mocking humor at a character’s expense — warmth is priority.

## Instructions for Agents

**For WRITER**: Stay in third-person limited around Nia. Anchor each scene in a sensory detail from the harbor or the paper craft. Use fragments sparingly for emotional landing. Keep dialogue clear and kind.

**For EDITOR**: Preserve fragments and parallel lists when they signal mood. Do not replace maritime nouns with generic ones; they are part of the voice texture.

**For PROOFREADER**: Treat fragment endings and parallel noun strings as intentional. Avoid adding intensity or grit; tone must remain gentle.
