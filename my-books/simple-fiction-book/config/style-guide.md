## Document Purpose

Keep the book readable for middle-grade readers while preserving the gentle harbor tone described in author-voice.md.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Overall Tone

**Choose one**:
- [ ] Formal (academic, professional)
- [ ] Semi-formal (expert but accessible)
- [x] Conversational (friendly, personal)
- [ ] Intimate (like a letter to a friend)

### Voice Description
Warm, hopeful, gently poetic, maritime, clear.

### Voice Sample

**DON'T do this** (too dramatic, too adult):
> The storm’s aftermath resembled a battlefield, and Nia steeled herself for war.

**DO this** (gentle, sensory, kid-friendly):
> Rain left salt freckles on the dock. Nia brushed them aside and checked her folded paper boat for any damp edges.

## Addressing the Reader

### Pronouns

| Context | Use | Don't Use |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| To reader | you | thou |
| About narrator | she/they (third-person limited on Nia) | I |
| General statements | we, the town, neighbors | folks (colloquial), guys |

### Inclusive Language
- [ ] Use gender-neutral forms
- [ ] Avoid assumptions about reader
- [ ] Consider cultural diversity

## Vocabulary

### Technical Terms

Keep vocabulary simple. If a harbor-specific term appears (e.g., "cleat," "line"), show it with context rather than definition. Limit jargon.

### Marker Words (avoid)

- Very, quite, extremely (find a concrete image instead)
- Obviously, of course (avoid assuming reader knowledge)
- Epic, battle, war, slaughter (too intense for tone)

### Preferred Words

| Instead of | Use |
|--------|--------------|
| fight | push, effort, tug |
| devastated | quiet, shaken, uneasy |
| shouted | called, said, whispered, laughed |
