## Concept

### Logline (1 sentence)
> After a storm cancels her town's festival, thirteen-year-old Nia sparks a paper-boat regatta at dawn to remind her neighbors they still know how to gather.

### Synopsis (1 paragraph)
When the spring storm shutters Bracken Cove’s annual harbor parade, Nia feels the town’s usual hum go silent. Determined to shake off the gloom, she convinces her friend Mateo, the harbor librarian Aunt Jo, and the salty Captain Reed to help host a simple paper-boat race along the morning tide. Each chapter follows Nia collecting stories, folding boats, and coaxing wary neighbors outside. The regatta becomes a patchwork of handmade sails and handwritten wishes, ending with the tide carrying everyone’s worries out to sea.

### Key Themes
1. Healing through small, shared rituals
2. Courage in proposing joy when others hesitate
3. Craft as a bridge between generations
