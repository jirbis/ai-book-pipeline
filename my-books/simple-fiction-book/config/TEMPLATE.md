## Fiction Genres

### Literary Fiction
- Focus: character depth, language, themes
- Structure: flexible, often experimental
- Elements: inner world, symbolism, subtext

### Thriller/Mystery
- Focus: intrigue, tension, revelation
- Structure: mystery → investigation → reveal
- Elements: clues, red herrings, twists

### Fantasy
- Focus: worldbuilding, magic system
- Structure: hero's journey, epic conflict
- Elements: maps, magic systems, races

### Sci-Fi
- Focus: ideas, technology, future society
- Structure: "what if?" → exploration → consequences
- Elements: scientific concepts, futurism

### Romance
- Focus: relationships, emotional development
- Structure: meet → obstacles → HEA/HFN
- Elements: chemistry, conflict, intimacy

### Horror
- Focus: fear, tension, atmosphere
- Structure: normalcy → horror intrusion → climax
- Elements: atmosphere, pacing, psychology

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Concept
1. Idea → logline (1 sentence)
2. Synopsis (1 page)
3. Theme — what is the book about at a deeper level?

### Phase 2: Worldbuilding
1. Create `world.md` — only what affects the plot
2. Define world rules
3. Consider the "iceberg" — 90% of world is off-screen

### Phase 3: Characters
1. Protagonist — want vs need, arc
2. Antagonist — motivation, mirror hero
3. Key supporting characters

### Phase 4: Plot
1. Structure (3 acts / Save the Cat / Hero's Journey)
2. Beat sheet — key points
3. Chapter-by-chapter outline

### Phase 5: First Draft
1. Write fast, without editing
2. Goal: 1,000-2,000 words per day
3. Follow outline, but allow deviations

### Phase 6: Editing
1. Developmental edit (structure, characters)
2. Line edit (prose, voice)
3. Copy edit (grammar, consistency)
4. Proofread (typos)
