# Plot — Paper Boats at Dawn

## High-Level Overview

### Logline
> When a spring storm cancels Bracken Cove’s beloved harbor parade, thirteen-year-old Nia must rally neighbors to launch a dawn paper-boat regatta before their town forgets how to gather.

### Synopsis
Nia feels the quiet that settles over Bracken Cove after the storm wipes out the parade. Chapter 1 shows her spotting abandoned decorations and proposing a paper-boat race to Mateo and Aunt Jo. Chapter 2 follows the trio gathering supplies, convincing Captain Reed to lend lanterns, and easing townsfolk worries about safety and disappointment. Chapter 3 delivers the sunrise regatta: wishes tucked into boats, hesitant neighbors stepping onto the dock, and the tide carrying everyone’s shared hope out to sea. The story closes with Nia realizing that small rituals can reboot a community’s heartbeat.

### Theme
**Thematic Statement**: Small acts of shared craft can restart community joy.  
**Question**: How can gentle invitations overcome collective hesitation?

## Structure: Three Chapters (Three-Act Shape)

### Act I — Setup (Chapter 1)
- **Opening Image**: Empty docks, rain-worn parade banners, Nia holding unused paper streamers.
- **Catalyst**: She learns the parade is canceled and spots kids staring at a closed harbor office.
- **Debate**: Can a paper-boat idea feel important enough? She worries adults will refuse.
- **Break into Two**: Nia commits to a dawn regatta and recruits Mateo and Aunt Jo.

### Act II — Gathering (Chapter 2)
- **B-Story**: Friendship between Nia and Mateo; mentorship from Aunt Jo and Captain Reed.
- **Fun and Games**: Collecting paper from the harbor library, learning safe launch spots, practicing folds with kids.
- **Midpoint (Hopeful)**: First test boats float in the moonlit slip; small victory that the idea works.
- **Bad Guys Close In**: Rain threatens to return; townsfolk express doubt; limited supplies force them to improvise.
- **All Is Lost Moment**: A stack of boats gets soaked in a gust; Nia fears the morning will be empty.

### Act III — Dawn Regatta (Chapter 3)
- **Break into Three**: Nia pivots to lantern-light launches and asks Captain Reed to sound the horn as invitation.
- **Final Movement**: Families arrive quietly; wishes are tucked inside; the horn signals release.
- **Climax**: Boats glide out together; the community watches in shared hush as light spreads.
- **Closing Image**: Harbor sprinkled with drifting paper lights, echoes of laughter returning — a contrast to the empty opening docks.
