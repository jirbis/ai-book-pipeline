## About Scenes

A scene is the minimal unit of narrative where something **changes**. If nothing changed, it's not a scene.

### Scene Types

|-----|---------|-----------|
| **Action Scene** | Character pursues goal | Goal → Conflict → Failure/Success |
| **Sequel** | Reaction to scene | Reaction → Dilemma → Decision |
| **Information Scene** | Reveal important info | Setup → Revelation → Consequences |
| **Relationship Scene** | Develop connections | State → Interaction → Shift |
