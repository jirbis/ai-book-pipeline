# World — Bracken Cove

## World Overview

**World Name**: Bracken Cove  
**Genre**: Contemporary small coastal town  
**Era**: Present day, early spring  
**Tone**: Gentle, hopeful, salt-scented

### High Concept
> A small harbor town that measures time by tides and community rituals rather than clocks.

### Elevator Pitch of the World
Wooden docks, lantern poles, and a community that depends on both fishing and weekend markets. The storm has quieted the usual bustle, leaving damp bunting and empty benches; the story aims to relight them.

## Physical World

### Geography

**Story Scale**: One harbor and the few streets around it.

| Location | Type | Role in Story | Atmosphere |
|----------|------|---------------|------------|
| Harbor Docks | Waterfront | Launch site for regatta | Misty mornings, rope creak |
| Harbor Library | Community | Paper source, planning table | Warm lamps, kettle steam |
| Captain Reed’s Shed | Storage | Lanterns, rope, horn | Neat, smells of varnish |
| Market Square | Town | Where parade was canceled | Quiet, banners still hanging |

### Climate and Nature
- **Climate Zones**: Cool coastal, frequent drizzle.  
- **Flora**: Saltgrass, dune flowers along the path to the dock.  
- **Fauna**: Gulls, harbor seals occasionally visible at dawn.  
- **Natural Resources**: Fish trade, timber for boats.

### Technology Level
- Modern phones, simple radios. No advanced tech; everything stays analog and tangible.

## Society

### Political System
- Small-town mayor and harbor committee; decisions are informal and community-driven.

### Social Hierarchy
1. Harbor workers and captains — respected for safety knowledge.
2. Shop owners and librarians — connectors who host events.
3. Kids — often overlooked but central to community spark in this story.

### Economy
- Fishing, weekend crafts market, harbor tours in better weather.

### Culture
- **Customs and Traditions**: Annual harbor parade with boats and music; sunset bell rings on calm days.  
- **Holidays**: Spring harbor parade (canceled this year), midsummer lantern walk.  
- **Taboos**: Mocking the sea or ignoring safety whistles; cutting ropes without reason.

### Language
- Standard English; light maritime terms (cleat, slip, line) used sparingly with context.

### Arts and Entertainment
- Lantern-making nights, knitting circles at the library, harmonica music at the dock on Fridays.

## World Conflicts

### Current Conflicts
| Conflict | Sides | Cause | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| Parade cancellation | Town vs. weather | Storm damage | Resolved by regatta idea |

### Hidden Tensions
- Worry that younger residents feel unseen; the regatta addresses this gently.

## Rules for Writer

- Keep safety visible (adults present, well-lit docks).  
- Sensory anchors every scene: smell of brine, sound of gulls or horn, feel of damp paper.  
- Avoid heavy peril; tension is social and emotional, not physical danger.
