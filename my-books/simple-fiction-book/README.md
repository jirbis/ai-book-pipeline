# Simple Fiction Book — Paper Boats at Dawn

This folder contains a lightweight, ready-to-read fiction sample for the **Paper Boats at Dawn** project. It follows the same structure as other books in `my-books/` but keeps the scope to three short chapters for quick demos or read-alouds.

## Contents

- `config/PROJECT.md` — filled with project metadata, themes, and outline.  
- `config/author-voice.md` — concise voice profile (warm, harbor-scented middle-grade tone).  
- `config/style-guide.md` — formatting and tone rules.  
- `config/characters.md`, `config/world.md`, `config/plot.md` — story bible for the small-town setting.  
- `files/content/chapters/` — three drafted chapters ready for editing.  
- `config/progress.md` — progress tracker aligned to the drafts.

## Quick Story Summary

After a spring storm cancels Bracken Cove’s beloved harbor parade, thirteen-year-old Nia sparks a dawn paper-boat regatta so her town remembers how to gather. Each chapter follows her planning, recruiting, and launching a tide of wishes that brings the community back together.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Run a light line edit focusing on rhythm and sensory anchors.  
2. Add a short safety note or illustration callouts if preparing for print.  
3. Update `config/progress.md` once edits are complete and ready for proofing.
